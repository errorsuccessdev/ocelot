**Odin Code Emitting Lots Of Text**

This is a silly little program I made that allows you to type text into an ASCII art "computer". It supports dumb line wrapping and backspacing to a retained position on the previous line, which was a fun little challenge to get working properly.

This code would not have been nearly as easy or fun to write without the wonderful Odin programming language and its community. Special thanks goes to @RaphGL's [ncurses Odin bindings](https://github.com/RaphGL/Ncurses.odin), which were updated in real time to support this code.
